# Games-Wishlist-API


Going to create a Games Wishlist. 

This webpage will have a search bar where you can search any games from https://www.igdb.com/api

I already aqcuired a key and I also read the documentation saw that I have 7000 hits per day. So I won't hit a limit. 

This page will allow you to find a game . see the title year image genre and pulse/public rating of the game 

There will be a save button attached to hit. once it is saved it will appear at the bottom of the page the bottom of the page is the where the wishlist is kept. those will not be deleted if the page is refreshed. 

each saved game will have a comment field. where you can add or delete the comments. and a delete or remove button . 


Issues: trying to get fetch to work.
